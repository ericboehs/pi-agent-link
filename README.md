# pi-agent-link

Two-way messaging between [pi coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
sessions and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) sessions.

A pi session running this extension shows up in Claude Code's `/list-agents`, and
the two can message each other **in real time** — no daemon, no broker, no extra
services. It works by speaking Claude Code's own cross-session messaging protocol
(the mechanism behind `/list-agents` + `SendMessage`), so pi and Claude interoperate
natively.

Inspired by [pi-intercom](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-intercom) (pi↔pi);
pi-agent-link does pi↔Claude.

---

## What you get

- **Pi appears in Claude.** Every pi session auto-registers as a peer — it shows in
  Claude Code's `/list-agents`, and Claude can `SendMessage` to it. Pi peers publish
  live `idle`, `thinking`, and `tool:<name>` status.
- **Real-time inbound.** A message from a peer is injected into the live pi session
  immediately (idle → starts a turn; busy → steers the current turn). A blocking
  `ask` gets pi's next turn relayed back automatically; a plain `send` does not,
  so answering one is a deliberate act.
- **An `agent-link` tool for the pi model:**
  - `agent-link({ action: "list" })` — list reachable sessions and live status
  - `agent-link({ action: "send", to, message })` — fire-and-forget; nothing is relayed back
  - `agent-link({ action: "ask", to, message })` — send and block until the reply, returned as the tool result
  - `agent-link({ action: "reply", message })` — answer the sole pending inbound ask (`to` disambiguates)
  - `agent-link({ action: "pending" })` — list unanswered inbound asks
- **`/agent-link`** command to list sessions from the pi UI, plus a bundled skill so
  natural language ("message the other session…") just works.

## Requirements

- **pi coding-agent** — `npm i -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (or have `pi` on PATH).
- **Node ≥ 20.19 (22+ recommended).** ⚠️ On older Node, pi itself crashes at startup
  with `webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function` (a bundled-undici
  incompatibility). If you see that, run pi under a newer Node (`nvm use 22`). This is
  a pi requirement, not specific to this extension.
- **Claude Code with cross-session messaging enabled.** It's on by default in recent
  builds; if your Claude sessions don't appear in each other's `/list-agents`, start
  them with `CLAUDE_CODE_HARBOR_KITE=1`. (pi-agent-link auto-discovers Claude's socket
  directory — usually `/tmp/cc-socks` — and co-locates with it.)

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/ericboehs/pi-agent-link
# once published to npm:
#   pi install npm:pi-agent-link
# for local development (from a clone):
#   pi -e /path/to/pi-agent-link/index.ts
```

Then start pi normally — the extension activates on session start. Verify with
`pi list` (should show `pi-agent-link`) or `/reload` inside a running pi session.

Remove with `pi remove pi-agent-link`.

## Usage

**From pi → Claude** (in a pi session):

```
list the agent sessions             → calls agent-link({action:"list"})
message claude-code-7b: build passes → calls agent-link({action:"send", ...})
```

or `/agent-link` to list. Replies arrive back in your pi session automatically.

**From Claude → pi** (in a Claude Code session):

```
/list-agents            → shows  pi-<dir>
SendMessage to pi-<dir>: "what's the test status?"
```

The message appears in the pi session in real time; pi's answer is relayed back to
your Claude session.

## Recommended safety setting

Cross-agent messages are untrusted peer input. To require explicit approval for each
inbound message on the Claude side, set in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "crossSessionInbound": "hold" }
```

(`accept` delivers silently, `refuse` opts out.) See **Security** below.

## How it works

A single in-process TypeScript extension (`index.ts`) plus a dependency-free port of
Claude's wire protocol (`claude-protocol.ts`). No build step — pi runs TypeScript
directly.

- **`session_start`** → bind a Unix socket at `‹Claude's socket dir›/cc-socks/<pid>.sock`
  and write `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, registering the pi session as a Claude peer.
- **inbound** (a `type:"user"` frame) → strip the `<cross-session-message>` envelope →
  `pi.sendUserMessage(...)` (real-time) + send a delivery receipt + record the sender.
  The sender's display name is resolved from Claude's registry so it matches `/list-agents`.
- **pi lifecycle events** → keep the registry status current as `idle`, `thinking`,
  or `tool:<name>`.
- **`agent_end`** → relay pi's reply back to the recorded sender(s).
- **`agent-link` tool** → `list` reads Claude's registry (live-filtered); `send`/`ask`
  connect to the target's socket and write a peer frame; `reply` answers a pending
  inbound ask explicitly, while `pending` lists unresolved asks.
- **`session_shutdown`** → unlink the socket and remove the registry entry.

There's no broker or daemon — **Claude's session registry is the hub.** Anything else
registered in that hub is also visible to `list`.

## Security

Messages between agents are **peer input, not user authority**:

- On the **Claude** side they arrive as `origin.kind:"peer"` and are subject to the
  `crossSessionInbound` gate (use `"hold"` to approve each one).
- On the **pi** side, injected messages are framed *"from another agent, not your
  user"* — the model is instructed to treat them as peer requests and not as your
  approval.
- Sockets are `0600` inside a `0700` directory: the boundary is your **user account**
  (a same-user process could already reach these).
- **Do not wire this extension to external/automated inputs.** It is a path for
  untrusted content to reach a permissioned agent — keep the input side to things a
  human sends.

## Development / testing

Extensions are plain TypeScript run in-process (no build). The `test/` harnesses drive
a real pi rpc session end-to-end; run them under a pi-compatible Node:

```bash
# override how pi is launched if `pi` on PATH isn't on a new enough Node:
#   export PI_CMD="/path/to/node22 /path/to/pi/dist/cli.js"
node --experimental-strip-types test/reg-test.mjs     # registration + cleanup
node --experimental-strip-types test/roundtrip.mjs    # inbound relay + outbound tool
```

`dev-run.sh` launches pi with the extension loaded for interactive testing.

Enable debug logging with `PI_AGENT_LINK_DEBUG=1` (or `touch
/tmp/pi-agent-link-debug.on`); logs go to `/tmp/pi-agent-link-debug.log`.

The startup banner (`pi-agent-link active as "…"`) is off by default. Enable it
with `PI_AGENT_LINK_BANNER=1` (or `touch /tmp/pi-agent-link-banner.on`).

## Compatibility

Verified against **pi-coding-agent 0.80.6** and **Claude Code 2.1.224**. The Claude
side relies on its cross-session messaging protocol; if a future Claude release
changes it, `claude-protocol.ts` is the single place to update.
