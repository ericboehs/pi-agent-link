## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Startup banner is now off by default. Opt in via env `PI_CLAUDE_LINK_BANNER`
  or the sentinel file `/tmp/pi-claude-link-banner.on`. (Previously the banner
  printed by default and could be silenced with `PI_CLAUDE_LINK_QUIET` /
  `/tmp/pi-claude-link-quiet.on`; those no longer have any effect.)

### Fixed
- Peer name now tracks the pi session's display name. Previously the name was
  captured once at `session_start`, so a name set via `/name`, `--name`, RPC, or
  `pi.setSessionName()` after that moment was ignored and the session appeared in
  Claude's `/list-agents` as the `pi-<cwd>` fallback. The extension now listens for
  `session_info_changed` (and reconciles on `turn_start`) and pushes the current
  name to Claude's registry so `/list-agents` updates live.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-08

Initial release.

### Added
- Pi sessions auto-register as peers in Claude Code's registry and appear in
  `/list-agents` (on `session_start`; cleaned up on `session_shutdown`).
- Real-time inbound: messages from Claude are injected into the live pi session via
  `pi.sendUserMessage` (idle → new turn; busy → steer), with delivery receipts.
- Reply relay: pi's answer is sent back to the originating Claude session on `agent_end`.
- Model-facing `claude-link` tool with `list` / `send` / `ask` (blocking) actions,
  a `/claude-link` command, and a bundled skill.
- Sender display names resolved from Claude's registry to match `/list-agents`.
- Dependency-free `claude-protocol.ts` port of Claude's cross-session wire protocol.
