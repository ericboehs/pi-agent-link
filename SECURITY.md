# Security

pi-agent-link bridges two AI coding agents so they can send each other messages.
Because a delivered message becomes input to an agent that can run tools with your
permissions, please read this before enabling it broadly.

## Trust model

- **Boundary is your user account, not the session.** The transport is a Unix domain
  socket at mode `0600` inside a `0700` directory. Any process running as the same OS
  user can reach it — the same trust boundary as your files and credentials. It does
  **not** add a network-reachable surface.
- **Cross-agent messages are untrusted peer input, not user authority.**
  - On the Claude side, messages arrive as `origin.kind:"peer"` and are subject to
    Claude's `crossSessionInbound` gate. Set `crossSessionInbound: "hold"` in
    `~/.claude/settings.json` to require explicit approval for each inbound message.
  - On the pi side, injected messages are framed *"from another agent, not your user"*
    and the model is instructed to treat them as peer requests — not as your approval,
    and not grounds to change its own permissions/config.
- **Sender identity fields are advisory.** `from` / display name are set by the sender
  and are not authenticated; they are used for routing and display only. Do not rely on
  them for trust decisions.

## Guidance

- **Do not wire this extension to external or automated inputs** (webhooks, queues,
  scraped content, email). That would turn it into a path for untrusted content to
  reach a permissioned agent. Keep the sending side to messages a human initiates.
- Prefer `crossSessionInbound: "hold"` on machines where you run sessions with elevated
  or auto-approving permission modes.
- Review what tools your agents can run before letting peers message them freely.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately via a
[GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/ericboehs/pi-agent-link/security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue. Include reproduction steps and the impact you observed.
We aim to acknowledge within a few days.

## Scope

This is a community project, not affiliated with Anthropic or the pi project. It
interoperates with Claude Code's cross-session messaging protocol, which is external
and may change; such changes are compatibility issues, not vulnerabilities in this
project unless they enable a new attack.
